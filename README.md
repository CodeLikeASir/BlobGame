## Overview

Blob's Tiny Adventure is a challenging 3D platformer where players control Blob, a slime-like character trapped in a test tube laboratory. Using a unique charge-and-release jumping mechanic, players must navigate through increasingly complex vertical challenges to reach freedom at the top.

**Genre:** Physics-Based Platformer  
**Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6.1
**Team Size:** Solo Project  
**Target Audience:** Precision platformer enthusiasts, speedrunners

### Gameplay
- **Charge-based jumping**: Variable jump height and distance based on charge duration
- **Blob deformation**: Visual feedback system with mesh deformation during charge/release
- **Air control mechanics**: Mid-air movement adjustments for less frustating gameplay
- **Traps & mechanisms**: Collection of easily reusable and combinable level components for efficient level building
- **Custom SFX**: Self-recorded sound effects for added fun factor

## Technical Highlights
- **Blueprint & C++ Integration**: Hybrid approach of using C++ for core systems with configuration and additional support (i.e. UI) via Blueprints
- **Save System**: Persistent progress tracking with best time records and completion statistics
- **UI/UX Design**: Clean, responsive interface with real-time speedrun times
- **Optimized level streaming**: Progressively loads in new level sections for improved performance and more interesting progression flow
